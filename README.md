A python program to solve the New York Time's daily [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee) puzzle.

Word pool taken from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt).

This is an imperfect solution because I'm not working with the NYTime's word pool, so there are plenty of words that my program finds that are invalid.
